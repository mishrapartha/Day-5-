# My function for median
mymedian<- function(x){
  g=sort(x)
  a=length(x)
  d=a/2
  h=(g[d]+g[d+1])/2
  i=g[d+0.5]
  ifelse(a%%2==0,h,i)
}

# Testing the function
b=c(13,4,7,10,8,5)
mymedian(b)
# Answer is 
#[1] 7.5
median(b)
# Answer is 
#[1] 7.5
e=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
mymedian(e)
# Answer is 
#[1] 5
median(e)
# Answer is 
#[1] 5
